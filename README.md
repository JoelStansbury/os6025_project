# os6025_project
repository for simulation scripts used for our operating systems project


## Getting Started (Development)
1. Install `git` from https://git-scm.com/download/win (keep all defaults)
2. Install `jdk-11` https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java11-windows (you'll need to create an account or login to download)
3. create a folder for git. Mine is `C:\Users\stans\Documents\Projects\git` but anywhere is fine. Also, it doesn't need to be called `git` I just like that name
4. open up a terminal `Start Menu`>`cmd.exe` and navigate to your `git` folder
5. After installing `git` you can execute `git clone 


### Add ssh-key
This makes pushing and pulling to the repo easier
