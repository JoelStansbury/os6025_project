# os6025_project
repository for simulation scripts used for our operating systems project


## Getting Started (Development)
1. Install `git` from https://git-scm.com/download/win (keep all defaults)
2. Install `jdk-11` https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java11-windows (you'll need to create an account or login to download)
3. create a folder for git. Mine is `C:\Users\stans\Documents\Projects\git` but anywhere is fine. Also, it doesn't need to be called `git` I just like that name
4. open up a terminal `Start Menu`>`cmd.exe` and navigate to your `git` folder
5. After installing `git` you can execute `git clone https://github.com/JoelStansbury/os6025_project.git` to download the repository to your local machine
6. (If you're new to git) See https://www.atlassian.com/git/glossary for descriptions of common git commands.
    The most important ones are
    - `git status` to show what has changed since your last commit
    - `git add --all` to prepare all of the changes for commit
    - `git commit` to commit the changes to your local copy of the repo
    - `git push` to send your changes to the repo that is available online (i.e. https://github.com/JoelStansbury/os6025_project)
    - `git pull` to retreive any changes made by others
    - We all have local copies of the repo and git is useful because we can revert to any state at any point, so mistakes are not the end of the world. Just try to get a basic understanding of a command before you execute it to avoid the cleanup which can be time consuming.
  



### Add ssh-key
This makes pushing and pulling to the repo easier
